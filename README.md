# The New Beginner Java Game Programming Series

## Read Me First

This project was started in 2014, and slowly continued into 2016. The code found here was part of a tutorial series found [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLah6faXAgguMnTBs3JnEJY0shAc18XYQZ) on the CodeNMore channel. Remember that the code here is not the only way to do something, and the final video of the series discusses some of the good and bad design decisions made while creating this project, how it can be improved, and how developers are constantly learning.

An updated series can be found on the CodeNMore channel utilizing the LibGDX game engine as of mid-2020.

## Source Code

The source code for each episode in the series can be found here. Look in this repository and select the folder that corresponds to the episode number you are looking for.  Within that folder is my own Eclipse project folder, though you don't need Eclipse to view any of the source code or run it.

## What im adding:
I am adding MultiplayerSupport for this game. You can view the "JRPG-Game-Server" Repo for this. I will update and release the code then there.


# Releases?
As soon as i get a usable Client running, i will publish all files here.


# Fixes?
I did fix @CodeNMore's FontLoader, ImageLoader in order to export the Game as a JAR and deploy it on other machines.

# What did i change?
  I did change the Assets, but the overall structure of the Game is still the same. The Singleplayer also wont be affected by the Multiplayer.
  
# What do i might add?
  I am planning to add save/load support for SinglePlayer Worlds, means you can generate larger Worlds without loosing progress. 
  I cannot guarantee that these worldFiles will be compatible with those of the Server, so you may not be able to Upload the SinglePlayer WorldFile to a Server and play it together. However, i also might add a MultiPlayer Support (LAN-Play) for the Game itself, means you can just open a LAN Party wherever you are!
